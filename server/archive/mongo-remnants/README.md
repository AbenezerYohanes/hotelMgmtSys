## Archived Mongo/Mongoose remnants

Files archived (moved here) and notes:

- `createDatabase.js` - previously referenced `mongoose2`; archived because project now uses MySQL (Sequelize).

Files referenced in repository but not present at archival time:

- `server/database/mongo.js` (not found)
- `server/scripts/seed-mongo-superadmin.js` (not found)
- `setup-mongodb.sh` (not found)

If you need to permanently delete these, remove this folder after verification.
